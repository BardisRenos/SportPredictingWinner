# SportPredictingWinner

This repo demonstrates that a ML model can predict accurately


## Steps to follow

  1. We will clean our dataset
  2. Split it into training and testing data (12 features & 1 target (winning team           (Home/Away/Draw))
  3. Train the data with XGBoost 
  4. Use the best version of the classifier to predict which team will win
